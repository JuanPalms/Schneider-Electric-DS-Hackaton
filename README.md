# Schneider-Electric-DS-Hackaton
The data science challenge will consist in creating an image classification model, which from a given dataset, predicts what type of deforestation appears in the image with the objective of early detection of this type of actions in protected lands.


Procedure:

1) Perform data extraction:
  Using common python libraries I perform image preprocessing in order to feed the Convolutional Neural Network Model. 

2) Transfer learning 
  Using the keras applications trained on the Imagenet set I test the performance of two pretrained models in order to maximize the F1 score. 
  
3) Visualization
  Visualization of different performance metrics on the tested models. 
  
4) Predictions
  Based on provided test images I perform predictions upon it.
